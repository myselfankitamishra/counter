    Pretty nice html, simple and efficient.
    Few points:
    - you would confuse your collaborators if you set a class to div. When I am looking at the css, I need to think extra
        to understand which div I am looking at. Is it just a div element or a class div. So, its a good practice to 
        name your classes with more distinct words.
    - When I look at the html, I want to understand how it will look on the page without looking at the style file.
        And your structure of html does not indicate that there is two "cells" in a vertical alignment
        I would wrap buttons in a separate div to indicate this for example.
    - Small thing from ux perspective more than anything - if I'd have these 3 buttons in one row, I would start with 
        reset, than - and finally +. In general minus / plus functionality is done from left to write, at least in
        the western culture.
        Or, I'd even make them into two rows, on the first - and +. And underneeth them a reset button.
