<!-- 
    Hi! Again, it was pretty good, and you have completed your assignemnt as it was asked.
    (Minus a small thing to which I get a bit later). So, great job!
    There are of course few things that you can improve on. 
    For instance, its a good practice to keep your formatting the same, so try to use the 
    same indentention levels for the lines that "siblings" to each other.

            <!-- You do not need comma to separate properties inside html tag -->

            <!-- 
                The task was that minus button should be disabled when the counter is 0
                And while your button does not allow the counter to change when the counter is 0,
                visually it is not communicated to the user.
                The "proper" way for this is to use disabled property of the button.
                disabled="true" - would disable the button.
                So, you can change your js updateCounterDispay() function to check for the value of the counter
                and if its more than 0 - set disabled property to false
